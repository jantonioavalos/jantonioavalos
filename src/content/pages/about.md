My name is **Juan Antonio Avalos** and I live at Guadalajara, MX. I've been working in the tech industry for almost 10 years. And I have contributed to Embedded Systems, Web Development and UX Design teams.

> I'm fascinated with the idea of creating extensions of our minds.

I believe in combining hardware and software with social sciences to make tools that adapt naturally to our way of living. Technology must be an **enhancer of our skills**, the automation of the busy work to free space for doing the creative work.

I started my career as an electronics technician, before college. It was exciting to design and build prototypes. But I realized that software had the power to change the hardware's behavior and **connect with people**. That's why I studied software engineering. However, digital interactions are complex. People need a better approach from software to **adapt their context and satisfy their actual needs**.

> So I found a way to meet business, content and people. I became an autodidact user experience designer.

Today, I'm a UX Architect Certified by Nielsen Norman Group. I lead Content Strategy, UX/UI Design, and Web Development teams to build standardized and usable solutions for people. Because I continue working on adapting technology to us, so we can improve our talents and **focus on creating**.
