So here’s how to transform your survey, usability tests or heatmaps, into product requirements:

1. **Identify** the issues and the metrics behind. _Clicks_ and _views_ are not meaningful analytics
2. **Brainstorm** with your team on solutions about the research insights
3. **Prioritize** in a list, what should be done first. Consider:

- **Technical feasibility.** Is it doable with your current technology and team skills?
- **Business/Project budget.** Is that affordable with your resources?
- **Production time.** How long does it take to be released?
- **Impact for the user.** Is this the most painful problem the user has?

At last, take the top items and transform them into [user stories](https://uxdesign.cc/how-to-write-meaningful-user-stories-3bcb1d51ff) and _wireframes_. This will auto-generate your first **product requirements document (_PRD_)**.

### Here’s a free template to refine your document:
