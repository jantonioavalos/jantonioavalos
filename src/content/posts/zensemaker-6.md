Here are some diagrams you can use to frame a problem from different angles:

- **Block diagrams** to illustrate concepts built by objects, their attributes and interrelationships.
- **Flow diagrams to describe the steps on a** process, their connections and flow conditions.
- **Venn diagrams** to highlight how different concepts or objects relate or connect.
- **Hierarchy diagrams** to draw the relation between people, places and concepts.
- **Mind maps** illustrates the connections between concepts, objects, ideas, channels, people, and places within a particular context.
