Side-projects are never a priority. Do you remember those internal tools, book clubs, podcasts, blogs or health routines that were never done?

After those energetic starts, use these 4 steps to prepare a _shared-place_ and ensure progress:

1. **Create a single-source-of-truth** for knowledge and activities. Use a [Wiki](https://www.notion.so/guides/how-to-build-a-wiki-for-your-product-team) and [Kanban](https://blog.trello.com/kanban-101) apps.
2. **Set recurrent reviews** and block execution times. Use a [shared calendar](https://www.any.do/) and a [task focus](https://www.focustodo.cn/) app.
3. **Prepare agendas** with expected outcome and track tasks with a person and deadline assigned.
4. **Build relationships instead of transactions** and ensure points of contact per topic. Use a simple [personal CRM](https://www.ourfabriq.com/) and schedule [1:1s with every person](https://fellow.app/blog/2019/one-on-one-meeting-definitive-guide/) in your team.
