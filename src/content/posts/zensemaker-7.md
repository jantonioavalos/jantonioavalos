**1. Explain to your team the rules for a safe space**

- Every opinion is valid
- It’s not personal. Focus on facts, not blaming someone.
- Open-minded listening to detect opportunities

**2. Choose the questions template for a better perspective**

- **[Quick retrospectives](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_k0AC2sQ=/)** define the team’s key focuses of attention
- **[Mad, Sad, Glad](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwzGOxM=/)** format to understand your team’s emotional health and consider changes
- **[Start, Stop, Continue](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kwz5R7A=/)** template to focus the team on new habits by defining what to do or don’t
- **[Sailboat](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_khOmVHc=/)** framework helps to define the vision for the team and anticipate problems ahead
- **[The 4 L’s](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_leP5Cwo=/)** look at the current situation from a factual perspective

**3. Schedule action items with owners and follow-up dates**

They will help as calendar remainders and keep track on people and tasks progress.
