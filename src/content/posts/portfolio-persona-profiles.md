**Summary:** I made research and design persona profiles to evangelize user-centered design across the company.

## Our audience

### Embedded Systems Engineers

They work mostly in "the Lab" surrounded by chips, boards, cables and equipment to test out their prototypes. But they're normally in a hurry while solving component's integration problems. So they hate unexpected issues or wasting time in activities that wonâ€™t represent progress.

### Applications Engineers

They are on charge of the emulation and testing of prototypes. They work in a multi-disciplinary group switching from status and design meetings to the tests' laboratory. Even they are the center of suggestions to analyze, they usually prefer doing some own research.

### Research & Development Managers

They coordinate product projects with teams from the Hardware, Software, Mechanical and Marketing groups. They abstract needs to generate a Proof-Of-Concept, negotiate for resources, schedule, and features with management so they normally lead the technology discussions.

## Customer Journeys

By the time, I met the customer support team and after an interview they facilitated some information to map 3 journeys people navigate when looking for something in our website:

### Research

On exploration of technology, evaluating or comparing specifications.
